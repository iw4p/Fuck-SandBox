# Fuck SandBox


<img width="500" alt="Example" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30632761/75926125-3b7b1100-5e7f-11ea-8680-df1ba196e3e7.png">


For security reasons, iOS places each app (including its preferences and data) in a sandbox at install time. A sandbox is a set of fine-grained controls that limit the appâ€™s access to files, preferences, network resources, hardware, and so on. As part of the sandboxing process, the system installs each app in its own sandbox directory, which acts as the home for the app and its data.

So? @#&! Sandbox

## Benefits?
Get list of installed apps info, like name, bundle, short version and type of App (It can be a System app or user app)

Sorry for noob programming, I'm not an iOS developer.
